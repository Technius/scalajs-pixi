# Scala.js facades for Pixi.js

This is an experimental library that provides facades for
[Pixi.js](https://lhorie.github.io/mithril/index.html). It is untested and
incomplete (and will probably stay that way for a while), so it's
highly likely that it currently doesn't work. Feel free to try it out, though.

You can find some examples in the
[examples folder](https://github.com/Technius/scalajs-pixi/tree/master/examples).
